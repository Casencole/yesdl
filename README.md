I made a dungeon-style terminal game in class, and it gave me inspiration to remake the game a few
months later, but I wanted to try to do it a more graphical way, so I did (it's *functional* but not
pretty). Originally made in c and after some consideration i switched to c++ to allow more object 
oriented design.

Dear future me when you inevitably have SDL broken again use this (once I finish making tactfully
instruction)
# Getting SDL set up:
## Linux
There are some commands that I don't remember, but it was super easy, and I'll put them in here at
some point when I am setting up my next distro

## Windows
Good Luck....
I recommend putting SDL and all its extensions in the project directory. It is a much easier way then
having them somewhere else, but you do have the added problem of needing to do it for every project
rather than just the one, but it's not too hard after you got yourself a template
